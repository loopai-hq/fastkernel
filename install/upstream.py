"""Install supported upstream models: a target repository and the draft
trained for its architecture, as an assembly (assembly.py).

The Hub owns downloads and snapshots; this module inspects the target,
selects its components and decides when to follow the Hub. The engine owns
the model rules, which it applies to the target's and the draft's
configurations, and a GGUF's metadata, before any weight download
(check_model), and its source adapters own tensor validation and
preparation. A target's family is the one the engine finds its
configuration (an MLX config, or the one derived from a GGUF header) to
describe, paired with the draft trained for it (families.py); repository
names play no part. Every start follows the target's revision, then its
draft's, with one Hub request each, and publishes a new commit's assembly
atomically; the installed assembly starts when the Hub cannot answer or the
new commit cannot be installed.
