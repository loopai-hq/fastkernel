"""The weight images two builds load from one model, compared by their bytes.

A build's engine-tests/weight-digests loads a model as its engine does and
prints the component, size and SHA-256 of every image it holds
(dev/tools/weight_digests.mm). Both builds must load the same images with the
same bytes.

Builds of earlier releases have no weight-digests and loaded a package's
files as they are, so a package's are not compared with theirs. Those that
prepared an assembly's images into a cache, <cache>/<key>/{weights, sha256,
source}, have build/engine/WeightPreparationIdentity.hpp: such a baseline
prepares into a cache of its own, whose images are compared after its rounds.
Once the release baselines of assemblies have weight-digests, delete
IDENTITY_HEADER, PROVENANCE, DIGEST, baseline_environment and prepared, and
compare_builds' environment with the baseline environment that
backend_regression passes it.
