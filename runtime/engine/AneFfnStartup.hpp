// alone as calibrated (ops::ane_ffn::Breaker), which forgets the calibration
// when it trips, so that the next start calibrates again; a given split
// takes the given least chunk, no breaker, and nothing remembered. Logs the
// outcome. A failure leaves the GPU alone, unless `cancelled` returns true,
// the wait for the ANE was interrupted or the backend no longer serves, which
// the failure's exception reports. Throws std::invalid_argument for a given
