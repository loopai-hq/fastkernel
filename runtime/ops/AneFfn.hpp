// The dense FFN of a prefill chunk split by intermediate channel between the
// GPU and the Neural Engine. The GPU runs the leading channels with its
// prefill kernels over views of the projections' affine Q4 or GGUF planes;
// the ANE runs the rest as one W8A8 program over the chunk's rows, with int8
// weights the GPU requantizes from those planes one layer ahead into
// double-buffered surfaces, and the GPU adds the ANE's partial down projection
// to its own. A shared event orders each layer's ANE evaluation between the
// GPU's packing of its inputs and that join, within the one prefill command
// (ane::Handoff). Any failure of the ANE's work stops the split for the life
// of the process: finish() then reports the command's results unusable, and
// the caller runs the chunk again on the GPU alone, which every later chunk
// runs too. A split that loses to the GPU alone stops the same way, after a
// command whose results are usable (setBreaker).
